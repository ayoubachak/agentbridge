# AgentBridge for Flutter (Skeleton)

This is a skeleton structure for the AgentBridge Flutter SDK. The Flutter implementation would follow similar architectural principles as the React Native SDK but would be implemented using Flutter/Dart.

## Planned Structure

```
packages/mobile/flutter/
├── lib/                     # Dart source code
│   ├── src/                 # Implementation details
│   │   ├── adapter.dart     # Flutter adapter implementation
│   │   ├── components.dart  # Flutter UI components
│   │   └── utils.dart       # Utility functions
│   └── agentbridge.dart     # Main entry point
├── pubspec.yaml             # Package definition and dependencies
└── example/                 # Example Flutter application
```

## Implementation Strategy

The Flutter SDK would implement the same core functionality as the React Native SDK, including:

1. **Flutter-specific Adapter**: A Flutter implementation of the `FrameworkAdapter` interface.
2. **Flutter UI Components**: Custom Flutter widgets that can be controlled by AI agents.
3. **State Management**: Integration with Flutter's state management solutions.
4. **Platform-specific Features**: Access to device capabilities like camera, location, etc.

## Integration Approach

In a Flutter application, the AgentBridge would be integrated as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:agentbridge_flutter/agentbridge.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    AgentBridgeProvider(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Access AgentBridge via InheritedWidget pattern
    final agentBridge = AgentBridge.of(context);
    
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('AgentBridge Flutter Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: AgentButton(
            agentId: 'submitButton',
            child: Text('Submit'),
            onPressed: () {
              // Button logic
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. Set up proper Dart package structure
2. Implement core adapter functionality
3. Create Flutter-specific UI components
4. Develop platform-native function calling mechanism
5. Build example applications demonstrating integration
